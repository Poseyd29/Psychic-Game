	//alert("You have 9 guesses to guess what letter I am thinking of! Good luck...");
  //I just commented this out because I hate popups haha

  var letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]

  
  // #1 take the [] off of this math function, [] declares an array, so you are making an array of a random number
  var secLetter = Math.floor(Math.random() * letters.length);
  //The math function is correct, but right now it is just pushing out a random number that is between 1-26. 

  //look in the console, you should see a random number every time you refresh
  console.log(secLetter);

  // #2 You need to use that number to choose a value in the array. So think about how you find a specific value in and array, and remember that your number is stored in a variable. You can name a new variable that is equal to the random letter you pick out of the array. 

  
  var guessCount = 0;	

  // #3 next we need to create a function that listens for the user to press a letter on the keyboard. Look a the rock, paper, scissors game that we made in class

  // #4 once we have that, we have to compare the value from that function ^^^ to the randoms letter we selected in #2, so:
   if(whatEverTheUserGuess === theRandomLeterYouSelected) {
    //add to the score
    //prompt that they have won
  }
